# Anticipez-les-besoins-en-consommation-electrique-de-batiments
Projet 4 OpenClassRooms

Consumption data can be downloaded at this address: https://www.kaggle.com/city-of-seattle/sea-building-energy-benchmarking#2015-building-energy-benchmarking.csv

## Purposes of the project:

### Predict CO2 emissions & total energy consumption of buildings:
Predictions will be based on the declarative data of the commercial operating permit (size and use of buildings, mention of recent work, date of construction, etc.)

### Evaluate the interest of the "ENERGY STAR Score" for the prediction of emissions, which is tedious to calculate with the approach currently used by your team
